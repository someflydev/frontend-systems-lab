## 2026-02-22 06:31:15 CST - Post-Flight Excellence Audit + Packaging Review

### Summary of what was audited

- Read all prompt plan files: `.prompts/PROMPT_00_s.txt` through `.prompts/PROMPT_07_s.txt`
- Compared prompt intent vs delivered repository artifacts across docs, code, tests, release files, and integration docs
- Audited completeness, release readiness, testing realism, operability, naming consistency, and complexity risks
- Produced `POST_FLIGHT_REPORT.md` and `FRONT_FACING_IDEAS.md`

### Top 10 issues found (one-line each)

1. Likely React build/typecheck break: `react-ts/src/App.tsx` uses `import.meta.env` but `react-ts/src/vite-env.d.ts` is missing.
2. No lockfile (`package-lock.json`/pnpm/yarn) undermines reproducible v1 installs.
3. No CI workflows despite strong smoke-check and release-gate claims.
4. Root `npm test` runs only unit tests, which under-signals actual quality coverage.
5. `tests/component/react-contract.test.mjs` is source-text scanning, not rendered UI behavior.
6. `scripts/check-a11y.mjs` is static source scanning, not runtime page auditing.
7. HTMX baseline telemetry payloads can drift from `shared/contracts/analytics-events.contract.json` (missing top-level `step`).
8. `react-ts/src/App.tsx` is a 979-line monolith, increasing maintenance and testability risk.
9. `scripts/mock-api.mjs` centralizes API/WS/metrics/failure simulation in one file.
10. Public v1 release posture is strong, but a `LICENSE` file is missing.
