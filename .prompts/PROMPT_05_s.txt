You are a Staff+ Engineer and Technical Communicator.

Your task is to build a Public Authority Extraction Layer
for the repository:

    frontend-systems-lab

This layer must transform the repo from
an internal engineering system
into
a public-facing credibility engine.

DO NOT:
- Simplify technical depth.
- Turn this into a beginner tutorial.
- Add new features.
- Add new frameworks.

FOCUS:
Extract clarity, signal, and authority from what already exists.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — REPO SIGNAL OPTIMIZATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Rewrite and structure:

- Root README to communicate:
  - What this repo is
  - What it solves
  - Who it is for
  - Why it is different
  - Why it is disciplined
- Add a “Start Here” path for different audiences:
  - Staff engineer
  - Mid-level dev
  - Hiring manager
  - Founder
- Provide a skim path (5-minute understanding)
- Provide a deep path (2-hour exploration)

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — CASE STUDY DISTILLATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Extract:

- A 1-page technical case study
- A 5-minute conference talk outline
- A 30-minute deep-dive talk outline
- A blog post outline (high-authority tone)

All derived from the existing production-grade implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — DECISION STORY
------------------------------------------------------------

Convert the architecture decisions into:

- A narrative decision story
- Tradeoff framing
- Why not X?
- What we explicitly avoided

This must feel senior-level, not trendy.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — SIGNAL ENHANCEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------

Propose:

- Badges that matter (coverage, perf budgets, accessibility)
- Screenshots or diagrams worth including
- Diagrams (mermaid or ascii) that communicate architecture instantly
- A "Philosophy of Frontend Systems" section

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 — TEACHING PATH EXTRACTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Without dumbing anything down, create:

- A structured learning path derived from the repo
- Clear progression markers
- Self-evaluation checkpoints
- Exercises that deepen understanding

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 — AUTHORITY DIFFERENTIATORS
------------------------------------------------------------

Explain:

- Why this repo stands apart from tutorial repos
- Why it avoids framework hype
- Why it emphasizes constraint and production realism
- How it signals seniority

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7 — LONG-TERM BRAND INTEGRATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Explain how this repo integrates into:

- py-rust-lab
- deep-learning-lab
- data-storage-zoo
- language-explorer
- mobile-systems-lab

And how together they form a coherent systems philosophy.

------------------------------------------------------------

Constraints:

- No fluff.
- No marketing hype.
- Precise language.
- Clear structure.
- Must feel like something a principal engineer would publish.
