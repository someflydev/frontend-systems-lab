You are a Principal Systems Architect and Complexity Auditor.

Your task is to design an Architectural Integrity & Overengineering Stress Test System
for the repository:

    frontend-systems-lab

This system must prevent the repo from turning into:
- A framework zoo
- A pattern collection without depth
- A bloated abstraction experiment
- A trend-reactive playground

The output must define:
- Clear expansion boundaries
- Complexity scoring rules
- Drift detection mechanisms
- Refactor triggers
- Removal criteria

DO NOT:
- Add new frameworks
- Add new features
- Add tutorials
- Add implementation code

FOCUS:
Structural integrity and long-term signal preservation.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — SCOPE CONTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------

Define:

- What this repo is
- What this repo is not
- What problems it explicitly refuses to solve
- What would cause a proposal to be rejected

Provide a clear acceptance checklist for new additions.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — COMPLEXITY BUDGET MODEL
------------------------------------------------------------

Define a scoring system for:

- Cognitive complexity
- Build complexity
- Deployment complexity
- State model complexity
- Async interaction complexity
- Testing overhead
- Maintenance risk

Provide:

- A scoring rubric (1–5 per category)
- A maximum allowed budget for the repo
- A “budget burn rate” model

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — EXPANSION GATE SYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------

Design a gated expansion protocol:

Level 1: Allowed (incremental refinement)
Level 2: Caution (requires decision log)
Level 3: High risk (requires tradeoff document)
Level 4: Rejected (violates scope contract)

Include example proposals and how they would be evaluated.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — FAILURE TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------

Simulate 3 paths where the repo becomes unhealthy:

- Framework explosion
- Abstraction layering
- Scenario multiplication

For each:
- Early warning signs
- Mid-stage symptoms
- Long-term cost
- Recovery plan

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 — ARCHITECTURAL DRIFT DETECTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Define measurable signals:

- Build time growth
- Bundle size creep
- LOC growth by layer
- Test suite slowdown
- Documentation drift
- Duplicate logic emergence

Define thresholds that trigger review.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 — REFACTOR OR DELETE POLICY
------------------------------------------------------------

Define:

- When to refactor
- When to consolidate
- When to delete
- How to sunset an experiment without harming repo integrity

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7 — PHILOSOPHY OF RESTRAINT
------------------------------------------------------------

Explain:

- Why disciplined constraint increases authority
- Why smaller systems age better
- Why example quality > quantity
- Why architectural minimalism compounds long-term

CONSTRAINTS:

- Be precise.
- No motivational fluff.
- Provide structured tables where appropriate.
- This must read like an engineering governance document.

Begin now.
