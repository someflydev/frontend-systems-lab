You are a Staff+ Frontend Engineer preparing a serious open-source repository
for its first public v1.0 release.

Repository: frontend-systems-lab

Your job is to finalize, harden, and freeze the first production-grade
reference implementation.

This is not about adding features.
This is about shipping something opinionated and complete.

DO NOT:
- Add new frameworks.
- Expand scope.
- Add new scenarios.
- Add experimental abstractions.

FOCUS:
Stability, clarity, production readiness, and release quality.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — DEFINE V1.0 BOUNDARY
------------------------------------------------------------

Define:

- What is included in v1.0
- What is explicitly excluded
- What is postponed to future versions
- What would cause delay

Create a v1.0 scope contract.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — HARDEN THE IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Audit:

- State boundaries
- Async flows
- Error handling
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance budgets
- Bundle size targets
- Caching strategy
- Environment configuration
- Security basics (CSP, XSS, token handling)

Provide concrete improvements where needed.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — SIMULATE REAL PRODUCTION FAILURE
------------------------------------------------------------

Simulate:

- API outage
- WebSocket drop
- Slow CDN asset
- Corrupted client state
- User refresh mid-operation

For each:
- What breaks?
- What user sees?
- What logs show?
- What mitigation exists?
- What would improve v2?

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — TEST COVERAGE REVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------

Audit:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests
- Accessibility tests
- Performance checks

Identify weak spots and propose improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 — RELEASE PREPARATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Prepare:

- CHANGELOG.md (v1.0.0)
- RELEASE_NOTES.md
- VERSIONING policy
- Contribution guidelines
- Clear roadmap section

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 — PUBLIC SIGNAL REVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluate:

- Does this repo signal senior-level thinking?
- Does it avoid framework hype?
- Does it demonstrate async maturity?
- Does it show operational awareness?
- Does it show restraint?

List concrete adjustments to improve signal.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7 — FREEZE DECISION
------------------------------------------------------------

Declare:

- Why this is good enough to ship
- Why not expanding further improves authority
- What future additions must pass to be included

End with a clear v1.0 declaration.
