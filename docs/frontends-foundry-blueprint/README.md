## Usage

1. Read section `00` through `09` in order for full context.
2. Use section `08` to drive initial implementation in `PROMPT_01_s.txt` and onward.
3. Use section `09` to evolve the platform without losing architecture discipline.

## Scope Contract

- Strategy and blueprint only.
- No code, runtime config, or implementation artifacts are generated here.
