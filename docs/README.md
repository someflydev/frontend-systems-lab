Repository-level architecture and operational docs for the initial artifact-first phase.

- `docs/shipping-model.md`: build, packaging, cache, and env strategy.
- `docs/repo-structure.md`: current repo topology and scope contract.
- `docs/decision-engine/`: constraint-driven frontend architecture decision system (provisional until PROMPT_04 gate evidence exists).
